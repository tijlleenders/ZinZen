## ZinZen®: a platform for planning your purpose(s).

[ZinZen®](https://ZinZen.me) is a platform for stress-free life planning.  
ZinZen® gives you the peace of mind to live in the now by making sure that:

- your life is on track with your priorities/goals
- your planning calendar is realistic
- you won't forget anything important

It is also a way to collaborate efficiently with others to achieve shared goals.

Explain ZinZen like I'm:

- a developer: "ZinZen is git - but for personal goals instead of code - and with a UI that anyone understands."
- a busy person: "ZinZen helps you plan like a pro - with the ease of a messaging app."
- five: "ZinZen tells the world about your dreams - and then people come and help you."
- a project manager: "ZinZen is a global multi-project management platform for individuals."
- an investor: "ZinZen will never be for sale - but we offer decent ROI on loans."

Phases:

- The first phase is a **smart** todo-app for a single individual.
- The second phase is be collaborative.

A lot of things in life can be managed by making lists (of lists...) with constraints and dependencies between them.
