## ZinZen: a platform for planning your purpose(s).

[ZinZen](https://ZinZen.me) gives you the peace of mind to live in the now by making sure that:
* your life is on track with your priorities/goals
* your planning calendar is realistic
* you won't forget anything important

It is also a way to collaborate efficiently with others to achieve shared goals.

* The first phase is a **smart** todo-app for a single individual.
* The second phase will be collaborative.

A lot of things in life can be managed by making lists (of lists...) with constraints and dependencies between them.

See ... for some ideas.

### Run the app online: [stable version](https://ZinZen.me) or [latest version](https://zinzen.vercel.app/)
...or run a pure local copy:
```
git clone https://github.com/tijlleenders/ZinZen.git
cd ZinZen
npm install
npm run dev
```

## ZinZen design principles
* (F) Free
* (E) Easy
* (SS) Simple & Safe

Also see our overall guiding principle: [Be good.](https://blog.zinzen.me/2021/11/12/Our-guiding-principle.html)

### Free
* F.1 No ads. Not now, not ever - period.
* F.2 Free as in as little cost as possible to download and use. Not being in app stores* is a consequence of this. Choosing for an offline-first webapp we can let you run most of the app for free - since it uses the resources on your phone and we only provide the software.
* F.3 Free as in open source. We're AGPL v3 licensed.
###### \* ZinZen is not developed/published for iOS as they have a fundamental incompatibility with GPLv3. The Free Software Foundation doesn't want GPLv3 apps in Apple Store (as Apple adds additional restrictions), and vice-versa. In general, at this moment we're not convinced the benefits of app stores outweigh the costs.

### Easy 
* E.1 One person in a team/family/group can use ZinZen as their primary todo-tool without negatively affecting the others, even if they use a different tool. 
* E.2 No tutorials up-front, but as-you-go: when buttons/actions are first used a quick explanation is shown and connected preferences can be set after using the feature a few times (not on first use). 
* E.3 Fast touch/click feedback (<100ms) so cause-effect connection between user action and interface response is clear. Offline-first makes this easy.
* E.4 Undo button always present (and clickable as much as possible) so users are not afraid to make mistakes. Redo not implemented as it complicates user understanding and backend. 
* E.5 No complicated config menu's but a simple list with clear explanation/example of settings.
* E.6 Non-intrusive tips/reminders on features the user never seems to use. 
* E.7 Suggestions for more efficient way when app detects user doing same (inefficient) thing more than x times. 
* E.8 Internet or gps not required (design for offline first as not everyone has internet/gps all the time - by choice or necessity).
* E.9 Scalable so app does not become slow or  unusable when user has lots of data or when many users use it. 
* E.10 No ads as these negatively affect user experience (and introduce security risks). 

### Simple & Safe
* SS1. Stick to the goal, and only the goal. 
Like Linux bash commands, ZinZen should do one thing, and do it well: help you figure out what to do and when. For example, is not necessary to re-invent document or image storage/editing tools, just point to or integrate with the one the user prefers, if this is needed at all. 
* SS2. Favor simplicity over complexity in the user interface as well as in the code base. 
* SS3. End-to-end encryption (TLS + encrypted storage sufficient pfor current features (single user), if necessary implement an open source end-to-end encryption protocol (ie signal protocol) at a later time). 
* SS4. Privacy by design and by default.
ZinZen does not want or need to know who you are. You don't require a phone number or email to register. Even better: you don't even have to register at all if you prefer because you can use the app purely offline or sync with your own servers instead of the official ZinZen servers (To make this possible whilst guaranteeing negative user experience, the quality of your own servers is monitored by the app so you will get a suggestion to switch to ZinZen servers if your own private servers negatively affect performance). This resolves the concern some other open source app maintainers have about allowing you to use your own private servers (ie Signal chat app). 
* SS5. If you want to help improve ZinZen you can turn on pseudonimized user statistics. This option is turned off by default.
* SS6. No ads as these introduce security risks (and  negatively affect user experience).
